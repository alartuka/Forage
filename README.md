## What it does ðŸ’»

Forage helps the dedicated staff (including delivery drivers, and external help) at foodbanks/shelters to optimize and streamline their warehouses by keeping track of their inventory.

## FEATURESâœ¨

- The website can display: available, up to date, live stock information (in the form of a database?)

- Volunteers/employees can take pictures of a wide variety of items and store them automatically in the database, with the ability to upload multiple pictures

- Volunteers/employees can ensure their data is secure, and can easily keep track of work hours and information input through a user/password login system

- The website has a â€˜clientâ€™ facing side as well as â€˜customerâ€™ side, clients being employees/volunteers and customers being shown a table of all the items available and their count

- Text updates: Sign up for text notifications for daily inventory updates, by subscribing to your food bank. You will receive information on instock items everyday

Not only will this prevent storage uncertainties and food wastage, it will also allow people in need to save time on searching for food banks that adequately carry what they need. It will also automate an extremely time consuming task that is 100% subject to human error, while streamlining the tracking inventory process at a much faster rate accurately, thereby decreasing the risk of inaccuracy.
